Arrowhead Village and Bachelor Gulch have great beginner and intermediate terrain. Centennial is a perfect cruiser, steep enough for advanced skiers to let it out at speed, but wide enough for intermediates to make lots of turns.\nThe trees between most runs at Beaver Creek are tight, so make sure your skills are advanced enough before steering off a run.

The biggest spread of beginner and easy intermediate trails surround the Bachelor Express and Arrow Bahn Express lifts that are a cat-track away from the main mountain.

From the top, go skier's right to Red Buffalo, Booth Gardens and the other trails off the Drink of Water lift for a more isolated beginner's playground. \u00a0\nBeaver Creek is also very kid-friendly with kids adventure zones placed around the mountain.

Jackson Hole also has spectacular views of the Tetons and the surrounding valley and is consistently ranked as one of the best ski resorts in North America.\n\n\u00a0\nThe Mountain\n\u201cOur mountain is like nothing you have skied before!\u201d read signs at the base and top of the 100-passenger Jackson Hole Mountain Resort (JHMR)\u00a0tram, which stretches 4,139-feet from the base area to the 10,450-foot summit of Rendezvous Mountain. The sign continues: \u201cIt is huge. With variable terrain from groomed slopes to dangerous cliff areas and dangerously variable weather and snow conditions. You must always exercise extreme caution. You could become lost. You could make a mistake and suffer personal injury or death. Protect yourself\u2014understand the trail map and ask questions before you proceed. Obey all trail signs and markers. Please think and be careful. Give this special mountain the respect it demands!\u201d   These signs aren\u2019t being overly dramatic. Even the most skilled skiers can find themselves in trouble around JHMR\u2019s 2,500 acres. The named runs are well marked though, so most often you have to go looking for trouble. You also have to look hard to find lift lines. Not counting the tram on a powder morning, a long line at JHMR is five minutes.\nStarting just below the existing Thunder Lift, Marmot lift rises 1,200 feet across Rendezvous Mountain to the top of the Bridger Gondola. Formerly, the only way to get from Thunder to the Gondola was to ski all the way down to the base area and then take the gondola up. The Marmot lift not only shines when you\u2019re starving at the base of Thunder, but also during early and late season. It\u2019ll let you stay most all day at mid- and upper-elevations.\nPowder Day\nPeople joke that a \u201cpowder day\u201d at JHMR is more a \u201cpowder hour.\u201d Locals here are hard-charging and can track out the area fast. In 1999, when JHMR opened the gates to lift-accessed backcountry, it was one of only a very few resorts to allow skiers and snowboarders to exit in-bounds terrain.\u00a0The Headwall and Casper Bowl are inbounds but still require a 20-minute hike from the top of the Bridger Gondola.   If hiking isn't your thing, Saratoga Bowl and Moran Woods, off Apres Vous and Casper, respectively, aren\u2019t as steep or as long as the Hobacks (off the Sublette Quad), but, because of that, do usually offer fresh tracks for longer. The trees to either side of Pepi\u2019s Ridge (Sublette Quad) can hold powder for a while, too.   If you have the necessary backcountry gear\u2014transceiver, shovel, probe\u2014and skills, go ahead and aim for some true backcountry. Rock Springs and Cody Bowl, both just south of the resort boundaries and accessed through marked gates, are good starters, albeit fairly easy to get to, so fresh powder doesn\u2019t last long there.   Backcountry runs in Granite Canyon, to the north of the resort in Grand Teton National Park and accessed from the top of the tram or the Apres Vous lift, are more committing. They require route finding skills, or, better yet, someone who knows the area and is willing to let you follow them. Know that even though you don\u2019t need climbing skins to get out of Granite Canyon, they\u2019re never a bad thing to have in your backcountry pack in case you do get lost. The way back to the resort from Granite Canyon is a traverse, but not completely downhill. Expect to expend some serious energy before popping out near the bottom of the Apres Vous lift.\nGroomers & Family\nConsider this fair warning: The ski area's only beginner terrain is off the Eagle\u2019s Rest double chair and the high-speed quad Teewinot lift next to the gondola in the base area. Together, the two lifts make for a nice learner\u2019s area. Once you\u2019re beyond beginner, you\u2019ll most likely find it boring, although the resort does a great job of cutting tracks into the woods between the wide-open runs.  Once you\u2019re an intermediate skier, you have quite a few choices at JHMR. If you don\u2019t want to worry about having to pay particular attention to a trail map (and perhaps ending up above a cliff), Apres Vous Mountain is your best bet. The smaller and less cliffy of the resort\u2019s two mountains is serviced by a high-speed quad from the top of the Teewinot lift and, heading skier\u2019s right from the top of the lift, has an array of groomed intermediate runs stretching its entire face.   The easiest intermediate runs on the mountain, which are still a big jump in difficulty for those coming from skiing the resort\u2019s green runs, are off the Casper Bowl Triple Chair. Easy Does It, Lift Line and Camp Ground are the most mellow runs off this lift.   Horn\u2019s Hole Traverse to Amphitheater from the top of the high-speed quad Thunder Chair is another of the resort\u2019s more mellow intermediate runs. The Bridger Gondola accesses a lot of intermediate groomers, but they are substantially steeper than the runs mentioned off Casper and Thunder. Gondola intermediates are generally moderately steeper than the intermediate runs off the Apres Vous lift.\nThe Mountain\n\u201cOur mountain is like nothing you have skied before!\u201d read signs at the base and top of the 100-passenger Jackson Hole Mountain Resort (JHMR)\u00a0tram, which stretches 4,139-feet from the base area to the 10,450-foot summit of Rendezvous Mountain.

In a cozy log cabin with a Tulakivi wood-burning stove, Nora\u2019s has everything from Banana Bread French Toast to a number of egg concoctions on the menu. There\u2019s usually a wait for a table \u2013 and everyone who walks in the door is subject to the same wait, even the occasional celebrity (David Letterman, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Harrison Ford) -- but seats at the U-shaped bar turn over fairly quickly.\nNora\u2019s Fish Creek Inn\n\u00a0\n5600 W. Wyo. Highway 22\n\u00a0\nJackson, WY 83001\n\nLunch\n\u00a0\nJHMR\u2019s on-mountain dining scene was one of the last things at the resort to go fancy. One look at the cupcakes and rice crispy treats the size of your face, the sky-high sandwiches, and Salt-baked Idaho Potato bar at Rendezvous at the top of the gondola, and you\u2019ll agree it was worth the wait. The Casper Restaurant has fewer choices, but the roaring open stone fireplace more than makes up for it.\u00a0\nIf your legs are aching to take a break from the mountain, Teton Thai is, without a doubt, the valley\u2019s best Thai food. Formerly hidden in a side alley just off Jackson\u2019s Town Square, Teton Thai has moved into a new building next to the $5 parking lot at the Village. From the base area, it\u2019s a five-minute walk, or you can hitch a ride on one of JHMR\u2019s big red buses constantly shuttling between the base area and the lot. You can\u2019t really go wrong with anything here, although expect prices to be a couple of dollars more than you\u2019d pay at a Thai place back home.\u00a0Teton Thai\n7342 Granite Loop Rd.\nJackson, WY 83001\n\nDinner\n\u00a0\nFor nights when price isn\u2019t an issue, Couloir, (307-739-2675) the fine dining restaurant at 9,065 feet atop the gondola, is hard to beat. Plus, any meal that requires a gondola gets some serious cool points. Couloir could stop there, but it doesn\u2019t. Its four-course prix-fixe menu includes some of the best dishes in town: Tenderloin of Buffalo; Pan-Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras; Spicy Grilled Ono with Coriander. Desserts come from one of the valley\u2019s best pastry chefs.\u00a0\nBack down in Teton Village, Il Villaggio Osteria (or just Osteria) inside Hotel Terra, has a very different vibe -- more hip than haute -- and what might very possibly be the world\u2019s best boar ravioli. The pizzas, cooked to order in a wood-fired oven, are pretty close to perfect. The fried olives stuffed with housemade sausage are out-of-this-world good. Located between Teton Village and Jackson on the Moose Wilson Road, Q Roadhouse has the most sophisticated menu of any roadhouse we\u2019ve ever seen: ginger lime salad, grilled South Carolina quail, quinoa not-so meatloaf (sauteed kale, green beans, smoked tomato and chipotle sauce), and sweet tea brined chicken fried chicken. In Jackson, locals love the casual option Snake River Brewery (aka \u201cthe Brew Pub\u201d). The Brew Pub has at least seven of its award-winning beers on tap at all times and the portions of everything \u2013 but especially the pastas \u2013 are huge.\u00a0Il Villaggio Osteria\n3335 Teton Village Dr.\nJackson, WY 83001\n\nQ\u00a0Roadhouse\n\u00a0\n2550 Moose Wilson Rd.\n\u00a0\nJackson, WY 83001\n\nSnake River Brewery\n\u00a0\n265 S. Millward\n\u00a0\nJackson, WY 83001\n\nApres/Nightlife\n\u00a0\nAround since 1967, the Mangy Moose is the classic Teton Village apres ski scene. It qualifies as a Village institution at this point, and the giant plate of nachos definitely qualifies as an institution. While the 20-something ski bums like the Moose\u2019s cheap pitchers, vacationers appreciate the extensive top shelf liquors, the skilled bartenders, and the quality live music (Medeski, Martin & Wood, G. Love and Special Sauce, Maceo Parker, Blues Traveler, Reverend Horton Heat, and Martin Sexton have all played at the Moose).\u00a0\nFamilies and those who prefer the soothing sounds of a live pianist to the press of the crowds often at the Moose might want to head to the Four Seasons Lounge instead. The soothing space \u2013 not to mention its sushi and sake menu \u2013 can\u2019t help but relax. In Wilson, the Stagecoach Bar is the place to be Thursday nights and Sunday Night. Every Thursday, the \u2018Coach channels the 70s, drawing most every 20-something in the valley to its dance floor, with Disco Night. Sunday nights are a completely different crowd. The Stagecoach Band takes the stage with its mix of swing, country, western, and anything else it pleases.\u00a0Smack on the Town Square in Jackson under bright neon lights, you\u2019d never call The Million Dollar Cowboy Saloon a ski bar, but it is a classic valley watering hole and has live music a couple of times a week. It\u2019s also got some of the best people watching around: real and wanna-be cowboys mingle with co-eds, the occasionally Hollywood star, and the valley\u2019s best western swing dancers. Sadly, you have to do your people watching from a saddle. There are no normal bar stools here.\u00a0Mangy Moose\n3285 W.

In a cozy log cabin with a Tulakivi wood-burning stove, Nora\u2019s has everything from Banana Bread French Toast to a number of egg concoctions on the menu. There\u2019s usually a wait for a table \u2013 and everyone who walks in the door is subject to the same wait, even the occasional celebrity (David Letterman, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Harrison Ford) -- but seats at the U-shaped bar turn over fairly quickly.\nIf your legs are aching to take a break from the mountain, Teton Thai is, without a doubt, the valley\u2019s best Thai food.

The High Camp Cable Car, also called the Tram, rises up and over the Tram Face, virtually un-skiable terrain where Squaw holds an extreme competition yearly for the world\u2019s elite. But don\u2019t be fooled: there are fantastic beginner runs located at mid-mountain. Take a leap of faith and ride the tram to High Camp, where four lifts offer mellow groomed beginner and intermediate trails. The payoff is extraordinary lake views, as well as the feeling that you are high in the mountains and away from the run-of-the-mill lower-mountain slopes that most resorts provide for newbies.\nHigh Camp is a mountaintop meadow tucked between high peaks where experts can get an adrenaline fix before meeting up with less skilled family members for lunch. High Camp has a swimming pool and skating rink as well as outdoor seating, providing an inspiring setting for all ability levels. For young children, the Papoose beginner\u2019s area is on the far eastern side of the parking lot beside the SnoVentures Activity Zone where you will find mini snowmobiles for kids and snow tubing for all ages. This is the learning ground for first-timers, completely unintimidating and with free hot chocolate.\nFor intermediates, Squaw Creek lift offers un-crowded runs and beautiful lake views, with groomers that loop down to the Resort at Squaw Creek on far looker\u2019s left of the resort. Squaw Creek offers classic American skiing, with trails cut through the trees\u2014something you don\u2019t get much of in the wide-open expanses of Squaw. Upper-mountain intermediate terrain is accessed by the Shirley Lake Express, a fast six pack lift perfect for doing laps. The Gold Coast six pack lift provides advanced intermediate runs. Round out the day with some laps on the Solitude lift, which drops down from High Camp into groomed and un-groomed intermediate runs, glades and tree islands.\nFor skiers who like to hike, Squaw has bountiful options. Granite Peak, accessed via Granite Chief, is the resort\u2019s highest point at just over 9,000 feet, so it loads well on powder days and offers lots of hidden stashes days after a storm. Hidden Bowl features steep wide open terrain and tree shots, making this area prime for exploration. The Palisades chutes are some of the most infamous \u201cSquallywood\u201d terrain, featured in countless ski films. If you go big here, lots of chairlift riders will be watching and cheering. Access Palisades via the Siberia Express, but be prepared to handle a cornice drop.\nLesser skilled skiers should stick to the easiest of the Palisades chutes, National Chute to looker\u2019s left. Named for Olympian Jonny Mosely, Mosely\u2019s Run is a severely steep bump run that Jonny credits with giving him the skills to handle the world\u2019s toughest moguls competitions. Squaw will never win any awards for its tree skiing\u2014there simply isn\u2019t that much due to the mountain\u2019s vast open expanses\u2014but those who seek a forested environment should head to the Squaw Creek and Red Dog lifts, as well as the lower sections of Granite Chief.\nAlpine Meadows\nThe terrain at Alpine Meadows ski resort consists of wide open bowls, long groomed slopes and abundant natural features within its 2,400 skiable acres. The ski area\u2019s front and backsides boast plenty of beginner, intermediate and advanced options.\nAlpine Meadows offers some of the best skiing and riding in Lake Tahoe with the newly named Pacific Crest Bowls, offering backcountry access to expert skiers with the proper equipment. Take the short (or long) hike out to one of these bowls, and then end up back at a high-speed chairlift. From the summit of Ward Peak, visitors can take in spectacular views of the surrounding mountains and Lake Tahoe.\nBeginners and intermediate skiers have numerous terrain options on both sides of the mountain. The front side is home to long groomers and some excellent intermediate runs off Roundhouse and Hot Wheels chairlifts. Then take Rays Rut around to the backside, where you\u2019ll access some of Alpine\u2019s best advanced\u2013intermediate runs.\u00a0\nSquaw Valley\nSquaw can look intimidating to beginners due to the steep terrain right out of the village.

This is the learning ground for first-timers, completely unintimidating and with free hot chocolate.\nFor intermediates, Squaw Creek lift offers un-crowded runs and beautiful lake views, with groomers that loop down to the Resort at Squaw Creek on far looker\u2019s left of the resort. Squaw Creek offers classic American skiing, with trails cut through the trees\u2014something you don\u2019t get much of in the wide-open expanses of Squaw. Upper-mountain intermediate terrain is accessed by the Shirley Lake Express, a fast six pack lift perfect for doing laps. The Gold Coast six pack lift provides advanced intermediate runs. Round out the day with some laps on the Solitude lift, which drops down from High Camp into groomed and un-groomed intermediate runs, glades and tree islands.\nFor skiers who like to hike, Squaw has bountiful options. Granite Peak, accessed via Granite Chief, is the resort\u2019s highest point at just over 9,000 feet, so it loads well on powder days and offers lots of hidden stashes days after a storm. Hidden Bowl features steep wide open terrain and tree shots, making this area prime for exploration. The Palisades chutes are some of the most infamous \u201cSquallywood\u201d terrain, featured in countless ski films. If you go big here, lots of chairlift riders will be watching and cheering. Access Palisades via the Siberia Express, but be prepared to handle a cornice drop.\nLesser skilled skiers should stick to the easiest of the Palisades chutes, National Chute to looker\u2019s left. Named for Olympian Jonny Mosely, Mosely\u2019s Run is a severely steep bump run that Jonny credits with giving him the skills to handle the world\u2019s toughest moguls competitions. Squaw will never win any awards for its tree skiing\u2014there simply isn\u2019t that much due to the mountain\u2019s vast open expanses\u2014but those who seek a forested environment should head to the Squaw Creek and Red Dog lifts, as well as the lower sections of Granite Chief.\nAlpine Meadows\nThe terrain at Alpine Meadows ski resort consists of wide open bowls, long groomed slopes and abundant natural features within its 2,400 skiable acres. The ski area\u2019s front and backsides boast plenty of beginner, intermediate and advanced options.\nAlpine Meadows offers some of the best skiing and riding in Lake Tahoe with the newly named Pacific Crest Bowls, offering backcountry access to expert skiers with the proper equipment. Take the short (or long) hike out to one of these bowls, and then end up back at a high-speed chairlift. From the summit of Ward Peak, visitors can take in spectacular views of the surrounding mountains and Lake Tahoe.\nBeginners and intermediate skiers have numerous terrain options on both sides of the mountain. The front side is home to long groomers and some excellent intermediate runs off Roundhouse and Hot Wheels chairlifts. Then take Rays Rut around to the backside, where you\u2019ll access some of Alpine\u2019s best advanced\u2013intermediate runs.\u00a0\nBreakfast\nLocated in the base village a short walk from the lifts, Mountain Nectar offers fresh-squeezed juices and smoothies, as well as coffee, tea, bagels, wraps and tables for sitting down with children.

Nose to Fingers is considered one of the best gets on the mountain. Access Nose by skiing looker\u2019s right of the KT-22 lift towers. The Fingers are a band of rocks about midway down the mountain.\nTo avoid the charge up KT-22, take the Red Dog lift instead. Its terrain is less skied but equally as challenging without the crowds. Poulson\u2019s Gulley, to skiers right of the lift towers, and Heidi\u2019s Rock are favorite steep and deep runs from Red Dog. Heidi\u2019s Rock requires a short hike and is reached by disembarking toward Red Dog Ridge. If the snow falls all day, head back to KT, which provides so much expert terrain that it hardly matters where you go because there are so many premier lines.\nThe Funitel (don\u2019t call it a gondola!) will typically open next. Ride it to High Camp and ski down to the Siberia Express lift, which whisks you to the ridgeline and the top of Siberia Bowl. On big snow days, the lifts typically open from looker\u2019s left to right, with Granite Chief often last to open. Granite Chief is located on the far boundary to looker\u2019s right, providing a bevy of unnamed runs and expert terrain where the crowds are often minimal, perfect for an afternoon expedition on a powder day.\u00a0\nAlpine Meadows\nThe resort is home to some great terrain for the powder lover. When snow is in the forecast, head to the lifts early to make sure you get fresh tracks. Hop in line at the Summit Express as this is one of the first lifts that will be open. Just off the top of Summit lift, the D\u2019s are a great first choice powder run, named for an old D8 tractor that accidentally slid over the edge while trying to clear a road to the summit.\nHaving merged with Squaw Valley, you can now take the free Squaw/Alpine shuttle between resorts, skiing and riding both mountains on one lift ticket. The Ice Bar is a local\u2019s favorite and can be found at the base of the Sherwood Bowl. Here you\u2019ll find quick bites and cold beers in a beach-like setting. Stay \u2018till happy hour on the Alpine Sun Deck and catch some great live music in the spring.\u00a0\nSquaw Valley\nThe first lifts to open are usually the Red Dog and KT-22 lifts. \u201cKT\u201d is the most coveted, and people line up at 6:30 a.m. to be the first to reach The Fingers, which are amazing when covered in deep snow but sketchy once skied out.
